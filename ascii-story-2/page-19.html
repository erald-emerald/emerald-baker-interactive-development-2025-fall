    <h1>THE HANDY COMPANION</h1>
    <p class="story">
      You keep the hand. It crawls into your pocket and becomes your loyal sidekick.  
      You two leave the graveyard and start a detective agency for cursed mysteries.  
      Finally something fun!.... You can’t help but wonder how your brother Sammy is doing.  
      Maybe you’ll go visit him.
